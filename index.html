              <h1 class="antraste" >Varian Wrynn</h1>
                <h4>Former High King of the Alliance</h4> 
              <p>As a boy, Varian witnessed the assassination of his father, King Llane Wrynn, and the sacking of Stormwind at the hands of the Horde. Years later, as a young king, he oversaw the reconstruction of Stormwind City and married Tiffin Ellerian, who gave birth to their son, Anduin. Varian's reign was interrupted when he was kidnapped by the minions of the black dragon Onyxia, an ordeal that left the two sides of his personality—his unshakable resolve and his desire for peace—at odds with each other. Afterward, King Varian would treat his opponents as mortal enemies, causing discord within the Alliance and distrust among the Horde.
                  But as the years passed, Varian became more and more influenced by Anduin, who showed an affinity to diplomacy. As tensions between the Horde and the Alliance exploded in Pandaria, Varian served as a mediator for the first time, tempering the cold tactics of war with an eye toward creating lasting peace. This culminated in the invasion of Orgrimmar with the help of a Horde rebellion. Varian's success solidified his position as high king, the commander of all Alliance forces.
                  When the Burning Legion invaded the Broken Isles, Varian personally led the Alliance's counterattack. The brutal fighting forced both the Alliance and the Horde to retreat, and Varian Wrynn sacrificed his life to allow his allies to escape.</p>

              <h1 class="antraste" >Gul'dan</h1>
              <h4>The First Warlock</h4>
              <p>Born on Draenor, homeworld of the orcs, Gul'dan was an outcast from a very young age. Utterly obsessed with obtaining power, he agreed to a secret alliance with the Burning Legion, a destructive army from beyond the stars. He drank demon blood and altered the fate of his people forever.
                  The blood transformed Gul'dan into something hideous, bent and twisted by demonic energies. With his lieutenants, he forged the nefarious Shadow Council and attempted to corrupt the many orc clans of Draenor so they would become agents of the Legion. His plan failed. A stranger from another time and place unveiled his deception, and the Iron Horde was formed without demonic influence. Gul'dan was branded a traitor and thrown into chains, and he was forced to help the orcs open the Dark Portal.
                  But amid the chaos of the war between the Iron Horde and Azeroth's champions, the warlock escaped, and he continued to work on the demons' behalf. After his masters' foothold on Draenor was destroyed, Gul'dan was guided to the Tomb of Sargeras, where he unleashed the Burning Legion's might upon Azeroth.</p>
