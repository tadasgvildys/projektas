                  <h4>Former High King of the Alliance</h4> 
                      <p>As a boy, Varian witnessed the assassination of his father, King Llane Wrynn, and the sacking of Stormwind at the hands of the Horde. Years later, as a young king, he oversaw the reconstruction of Stormwind City and married Tiffin Ellerian, who gave birth to their son, Anduin. Varian's reign was interrupted when he was kidnapped by the minions of the black dragon Onyxia, an ordeal that left the two sides of his personality—his unshakable resolve and his desire for peace—at odds with each other. Afterward, King Varian would treat his opponents as mortal enemies, causing discord within the Alliance and distrust among the Horde.</p>
                      <p>But as the years passed, Varian became more and more influenced by Anduin, who showed an affinity to diplomacy. As tensions between the Horde and the Alliance exploded in Pandaria, Varian served as a mediator for the first time, tempering the cold tactics of war with an eye toward creating lasting peace. This culminated in the invasion of Orgrimmar with the help of a Horde rebellion. Varian's success solidified his position as high king, the commander of all Alliance forces.</p>
                      <p>When the Burning Legion invaded the Broken Isles, Varian personally led the Alliance's counterattack. The brutal fighting forced both the Alliance and the Horde to retreat, and Varian Wrynn sacrificed his life to allow his allies to escape.</p>

                    <h4>The First Warlock</h4> 
                    <p>Born on Draenor, homeworld of the orcs, Gul'dan was an outcast from a very young age. Utterly obsessed with obtaining power, he agreed to a secret alliance with the Burning Legion, a destructive army from beyond the stars. He drank demon blood and altered the fate of his people forever.</p>

                <h2 id="trechias" class="antraste" >Illidan Stormrage</h2>
                    <h4>The Betrayer</h4> 
                    <p>During the War of the Ancients, Illidan Stormrage began his long struggle against the Burning Legion. He was one of many night elves who fought the demons, but his extreme methods would set him apart from the rest. Illidan's fiery determination led him to abandon his allies and make a pact with the Legion. Though he did so to gain power and learn the demons' weaknesses, his people would forever after see him as a betrayer. After defeating the Legion, the night elves locked Illidan in a barrow prison to prevent him from harming the war-torn world.</p>
                    <p>Over ten thousand years later, Illidan was freed. Rather than atone for his questionable tactics, he embraced fel magic and became a demon—a necessary evil to destroy the Legion. He eventually traveled to the shattered realm of Outland and forged a fighting force in his own cursed image: the Illidari demon hunters. With these fel-infused soldiers, the Betrayer was poised to end the Legion threat once and for all. But before he could, Illidan fell to heroes of the Horde and the Alliance. His body was taken to Azeroth and placed within the Vault of the Wardens.</p>
                    <p>Despite Illidan's defeat, his legacy lives on through his demon hunters. Some of these shadowy warriors are imprisoned alongside their master's corpse in the Vault of the Wardens, but many others remain at large, their whereabouts unknown. It is feared that even now these demon hunters are carrying on Illidan's war against the Legion... at any cost.</p>

                <h2 id="ketvirtas" class="antraste" >Sylvanas Windrunner</h2>
                    <h4>Warchief of the Horde</h4> 
                    <p>Sylvanas was once the ranger-general of Silvermoon, a commander charged with defending the high elven kingdom of Quel'Thalas. Her skill as a leader was put to the test when the Lich King's undead Scourge attacked her nation. Though Sylvanas fought valiantly, she fell to the unholy invaders. The Scourge death knight Arthas Menethil ripped out the ranger-general's soul and transformed it into a banshee, a vengeful phantom forced to serve the Lich King.</p>
                    <p>A year later, Sylvanas regained her freedom. She was accompanied by many other undead who had broken away from the Lich King's control. Sylvanas dubbed these renegades the Forsaken, and she named herself their Banshee Queen. To secure a future for her followers, Sylvanas joined the Horde. She and her Forsaken eventually marched alongside their new allies in the invasion of Northrend, helping defeat the Lich King and sating their appetite for vengeance.</p>
                    <p>Sylvanas has continued protecting the Forsaken from any threat, at home or across the cosmos.  Entrusted with the mantle of Warchief by a dying Vol’jin, she managed to rally the Horde to defeat the Legion in the Broken Isles and Argus.</p>
                    <p>The discovery of the mysterious material known as Azerite in Silithus has led Sylvanas once more down the path of war. Intent on preventing the Alliance from gaining control of this powerful substance, the Warchief struck first, leading the Horde’s assault on Darnassus and inflicting a grievous blow to show the Alliance exactly what is at stake.</p>

                <h2 id="penktas" class="antraste" >Vol'jin</h2>
                    <h4>Former Warchief of the Horde</h4> 
                    <p>Under Vol'jin's leadership, the Darkspear trolls became one of the first non-orc members of Warchief Thrall's Horde. Vol'jin quickly rose to prominence, becoming a trusted advisor to Thrall. In the years that followed, the wise troll played a part in guiding the Horde through crisis after crisis, and he earned the respect of orcs, tauren, blood elves, goblins, and Forsaken alike.</p>
                    <p>Then, Garrosh Hellscream became the Horde's warchief. His blind lust for combat troubled Vol'jin. The Darkspear leader believed that Hellscream's quest for blood and glory would bring ruin to the Horde, and so he openly challenged the warchief. Ultimately, Vol'jin and his loyalists led a revolt that helped oust Garrosh from power. Following the rebellion, the mantle of warchief went to the Darkspear troll. Vol'jin promised to right the wrongs of the past, and he vowed to restore the honor that the Horde had lost.</p>
                    <p>Yet Vol'jin was not destined to lead the Horde for long. After his faction had recovered from the rebellion, the Burning Legion launched a massive invasion of Azeroth. Vol'jin fought on the front lines with his fellow Horde soldiers, struggling to hold off the demons. In the midst of battle, he suffered mortal wounds... and his spirit later passed into the realm beyond.</p>
                    <p>Though Vol'jin is dead, he will always be remembered for his unyielding devotion to his allies, his unshakable honor, and his fearlessness in battle. These are the glorious ideals that he lived and died by—these are the glorious ideals that are the heart and soul of the Horde.</p>
